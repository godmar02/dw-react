# DW-REACT

This is a basic character sheet generator for Dungeon-World written in ReactJS and hosted on a Github Pages project page. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and created using the following steps:
1. Install nodejs, npm and create-react-app
2. Run `npx create-react-app dw-react` to create a new blank project
3. Create a new blank repository on Github
4. Add all files and committing them to the local git-repo and set remote origin
5. Clear out the src dir except index files and push changes to GitHub
6. Following the deployment instructions here [Deployment - GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to ensure the project is set up for a GitHub pages deployment

Optional steps to help with development:
1. Ensure browser has React Developer Tools
2. Ensure has 'react' and 'linter-eslint' when using Atom

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

- installs all of the listed dependencies in the package.json file

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

- Builds and then subsequently deploys to a 'gh-pages' branch of the your targeted git repo


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

- If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
- You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
